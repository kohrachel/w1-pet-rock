# Pet Rock Project

Every week, [@zineanteoh](https://github.com/zineanteoh) and I give ourselves an hour to create a goofy project solely with AI. No human coding, any idea you can think of.

This is my project for week 1. It's a rock.

Inspired by [Neal.fun](https://neal.fun/), built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

# Demo!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:kohrachel/w1-pet-rock.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd w1-pet-rock
    ```
3.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode using Vite.\
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or the port shown in the terminal) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

### `npm run preview`

Serves the production build from the `dist` folder locally.\
This is useful for testing the production build before deployment.

### `npm run lint`

Runs the ESLint linter to check for code style and potential errors.
