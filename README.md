# Pet Rock Project

Every week, [@zineanteoh](https://github.com/zineanteoh) and I give ourselves an hour to create a goofy project solely with AI. No human coding, any idea you can think of.

This is my project for week 1. It's a rock.

Inspired by [Neal.fun](https://neal.fun/), built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

# Demo!
